# cryptanalysis

RSA is one of the first practicable public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. 
RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1977.
In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret.

The main goal of the project is to find the private key corresponding to the given public parameters in a RSA cryptosystem. 
Then decrypt the given cipher text to obtain the plaintext message
